# Fusion 360 golden ratio spiral for the sphere

This is a python script for the fusion 360. This script is used to generate a solid sphere that is wrapped around with lots of smaller spheres. Here are some examples:

### Bigger sphere radius - ; smaller sphere radius - ; the number of the smaller sphere - ;
![]()

### Bigger sphere radius - ; smaller sphere radius - ; the number of the smaller sphere - ;
![]()

### Bigger sphere radius - ; smaller sphere radius - ; the number of the smaller sphere - ;
![]()

### Bigger sphere radius - ; smaller sphere radius - ; the number of the smaller sphere - ;
![]()

The script uses golden ratio points distribution. An interactive example can be seen [here](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/41142).

This script is completely free to use and modify and comes with a [MIT license](LICENCE.md)

## How to use

Right now script dosen't have a menue to input parameters from Fusion 360. You need to change this 3 values directly in the script file:

``` python
		small_circle_diameter = 1
		big_circle_diameter = 10
		number_of_circles = 1000
```

To run a script in Fusion 360 ...
